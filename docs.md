# Python Scientific Best Practice - Documentation

Documentation could be a hard topic to discuss, any project could have their own standard for what would be the best practice for documenation.

Motivated by a discussion at PyOpenSci community entitled [Good, Better, Best: required versus recommended changes by reviewers - your feedback is requested](https://pyopensci.discourse.group/t/good-better-best-required-versus-recommended-changes-by-reviewers-your-feedback-is-requested/160), this documented was created to re-compile recommendations from different **Groundbreaking** Python open-source projects. The projects analysed here was selected from this blog post: https://data-flair.training/blogs/python-open-source-projects/.

### Contribution guidelines

This section aims to get references related to documenation criteria used by selected open source projects.
